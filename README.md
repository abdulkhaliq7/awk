Thanks for the clarification! Given that your DataSplit method now returns an error, I'll update the README example to include error handling when using DataSplit.

Here's the revised README section:

Go AWK Package
Overview
The Go AWK package provides a simple and efficient way to process and manipulate string data in a manner similar to the awk command-line tool. This package is designed to handle large amounts of text data efficiently using Go's standard libraries.

Features
Data Splitting: Split strings by specified delimiters and extract specific columns.
String Replacement: Replace occurrences of a substring within the processed data.
Batch Processing: Process large datasets line-by-line to minimize memory usage.
Flexible Input: Process data from strings, files, or other sources.
Installation
To install the package, run:

bash
Copy code
go get github.com/yourusername/yourpackage
Usage
1. Import the Package
go
Copy code
import "github.com/yourusername/yourpackage/awk"
2. Create an AWK Instance
go
Copy code
data := `column1|column2|column3
value1|value2|value3`

awkInstance := awk.NewAwk(data)
3. Split Data
Split data based on a delimiter and choose specific columns:

go
Copy code
splitData, err := awkInstance.DataSplit("|", " ", "0", "2")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("DataSplit error: %v", err)
}
fmt.Println(splitData.Data)
4. Replace Substrings
Replace occurrences of specific substrings in the data:

go
Copy code
replacedData := splitData.Replace("value1", "newValue1")
fmt.Println(replacedData.Data)
Example
Here's a complete example using the package:

go
Copy code
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "github.com/yourusername/yourpackage/awk"
)

func main() {
    data := `name|age|location
John|30|New York
Jane|25|Los Angeles`

    awkInstance := awk.NewAwk(data)
    splitData, err := awkInstance.DataSplit("|", " ", "0", "2")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("DataSplit error: %v", err)
    }
    replacedData := splitData.Replace("John", "Mike")
    fmt.Println(replacedData.Data)
}
Output:
sql
Copy code
name location 
Mike New York 
Jane Los Angeles 
Performance Optimization
Batch Processing: The package processes data line by line, which is suitable for handling large datasets without excessive memory usage.
Custom String Splitting: By leveraging Go's built-in functions like strings.Split, the package ensures fast and reliable string processing.
